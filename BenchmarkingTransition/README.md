# Benchmarking Transition

> This directory is for the addition of downstream benchmarking pipelines which take as input the VCF(s) from the simulation.

## Bury Variant Within DeepVariant

> This approach is designed for testing interpretation of SNV/indels

## Simulate Variant using VarSim

> This approach is designed to facilitate the simulation of full synthetic WGS samples with variants incorporated into the sample

## Overview

GeneBreaker is developed by Phillip A. Richmond and Tamar V. Av-Shalom within Wyeth Wasserman's laboratory at the University of British Columbia. GeneBreaker is deployed as a website, and has an associated capacity for downstream benchmarking through this github repository. 

You can find the website with variant simulation capacity and previously simulated variant sets at: 

http://genebreaker.cmmt.ubc.ca

The manuscript detailing GeneBreaker can be found on biorXiv at:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.124495v1

For issues with the website, downstream benchmarking, or comments on the manuscript and tool, please post issues on this github repository. 

## Downstream Benchmarking

Downstream Benchmarking can either include full simulation of the variant(s) with VarSim, or burying the variants (SNVs and indels only) within background trio genomes. 

For details on how to use the downstream benchmarking, please go to the DownstreamBenchmarking/ directory.
